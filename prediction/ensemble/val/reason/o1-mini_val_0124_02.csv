A pure Ground Glass Nodule (GGN) with lobulated shape, measuring approximately 15 mm x 14 mm is found in S10 of the right lower lobe of the lung, suspecting lung cancer.
There are no obvious metastases or other active lesions in the lungs.
There is no significant lymph node enlargement in the mediastinum or hilum.
Cardiomegaly is suspected. There is no pleural effusion.
No obvious abnormalities in the visualized upper abdomen.
There is no ascites.
