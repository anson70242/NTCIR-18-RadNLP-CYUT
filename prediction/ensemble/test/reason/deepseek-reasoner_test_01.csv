Multiple nodules in the right lung, suspicious of contralateral lung metastases.
Nodular lesion in the left upper lobe, suggestive of intralobar metastasis within the same lung.
Enlarged lymph nodes from the left pulmonary hilum to the mediastinum, raising suspicion of lymph node metastases.","{

  ""Reason"": ""The primary tumor (36 mm) is classified as T4 due to a separate tumor nodule in the left upper lobe (different ipsilateral lobe). Mediastinal lymph node involvement indicates N2. A single brain metastasis (extrathoracic) and contralateral lung nodules (M1a) are present, but M1b (single extrathoracic metastasis) takes precedence over M1a.""

Irregular mass measuring 68 mm in the right upper lobe, suspicious of lung cancer.

Irregularly shaped mass in the apex of the right lung, measuring 68 mm along its long axis, suspicious of lung cancer.
Broad contact with the inner dorsal pleura and osteolytic changes in the adjacent vertebral body and right rib, suggesting infiltration.
