  ""Reason"": ""T4 classification due to the primary tumor size exceeding 70 mm (120 mm). N0 as there is no evidence of lymph node involvement. M1c because there are multiple extrathoracic metastases in both adrenal glands (M1b would apply if single, but multiple extrathoracic sites qualify as M1c) and a vertebral lesion (Th9), which further confirms multiple organ involvement.""

Nodular lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere with extensive surrounding edema, suspicious of a metastatic brain tumor.

Chest CT:
Findings of emphysema, indicating a predisposition to lung cancer.
Solid mass lesion approximately 36 mm in the left lower lobe (S10), suspicious of primary lung cancer. The lesion is in contact with the interlobar pleura, raising suspicion of interlobar pleural invasion.
Obstructive atelectasis involving part of the left lower lobe.
Multiple nodules in the right lung, suspicious of contralateral lung metastases.
Nodular lesion in the left upper lobe, suggestive of intralobar metastasis within the same lung.
Enlarged lymph nodes from the left pulmonary hilum to the mediastinum, raising suspicion of lymph node metastases.","{
